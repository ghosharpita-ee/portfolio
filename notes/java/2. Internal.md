## What are the key features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain both data and methods.  
Key features include:

- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into single unit(class).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding internal implementation details from user.
- **Inheritance**: Allowing new classes to derive properties from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Enabling a single interface to represent multiple implementation.

---

## What is Java

Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

- Java was developed by **Sun Microsystems** (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the **year 1995**.
- **James Gosling** is known as the father of Java.

---

## What is Java Bytecode?

Java Bytecode is an intermidiate representation of a java program generated after compilation. It's not Machine specific & is executed by JVM(Java Virtual Machine), making Java platform-independent.

---

## 3. What are the commands of compiling and running a Java program?

If we have a program named `MyProgram.java`, the commands to compile and run it are:

- Compiling: `javac MyProgram.java`, this will create a `MyProgram.class` file.
- Running: `java MyProgram`, this will execute the `MyProgram` program.

---

## 4. Write the meaning of “public static void main(String args[])”

This is the main method which serves as the entry point for Java applications.

- `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
- `static`: No object needed to call it.
- `void`: Returns nothing.
- `main`: Entry point of the program.
- `String[] args`: Command line arguments.

---

## 5. What is JVM?

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a platform-independent virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides the runtime environment necessary for Java programs to run on any OS with a compatible JVM implementation. Its platform independence is a core feature of the Java language

- The JVM loads, verifies, executes bytecode, manages memory (including garbage collection), and provides essential runtime services.

---

## 6. Why is Java called a portable language?

Java is called portable because its compiled bytecode can run on any device that has a compatible JVM implementation.  
This makes Java programs platform-independent, following the principle "Write Once, Run Anywhere"

---

## 7. What is an array?

An array is a data structure that stores a sequential collection of elements of the same data type.

### How is it different in Java?

- **Objects:** In Java, arrays are treated as objects.
- **Fixed Size:** Once an array is created in Java, its size cannot be changed..
- **No Pointer Arithmetic**: Unlike languages like C and C++, Java does not allow direct pointer arithmetic on arrays.

---

## 8. How are strings created in Java?

There are 2 ways of creating strings in Java:

- **Using String Literals**: `String s = "Hello";`
- **Using new keyword**: `String s = new String("Hello");`

---

## 9. What is for-each loop?

The for-each loop in Java, also known as the enhanced for loop, is a simplified control flow statement for iterating over elements in a collection (like list, set or arrays).  
It provides a more concise and readable way to access each elements without explicitly managing iterators.

```java
for (Type var : array) {
  // statements
}
```

---

## 10. Define class and object

### Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.  
It defines fields (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the properties and behaviours of an object.

- Example:

```java
 class Car {
    String model;  // Field

    void display() {  // Method
        System.out.println(model);
    }
}
```

### Object

An object is an instance of a class.  
It is a real-world entity that has state (data) and behavior (methods) defined by its class.

- Example:-

```java
Car myCar = new Car();    // Creating an object of the Car class

myCar.model = "Toyota";   // Access field
myCar.display();          // Call method

```

---

## 11. What is a method?

A method is a block of code that performs a specific task or a sequence of operations.  
It's a fundamental building block of a Java program,

### What is method overloading? Give example

Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.

- **Example**:

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
}
```

---

## 12. What is a constructor? Write down its types

Special method used to initialize objects.

**Types**:

- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor

---

## 13. What are the properties of a constructor?

- Same name as class.
- No return type.
- Called automatically.

---

## 14. What is method overriding? Give example

Subclass redefines parent class method.

**Example**:

```java
class Animal {
  void sound() { System.out.println("Sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
```

---

## 15. What is an abstract class? What is an abstract method?

- **Abstract Class**: Cannot be instantiated. May have abstract methods.
- **Abstract Method**: No body. Must be overridden.

---

## 16. What is inheritance? What are the types of inheritance?

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another.

**Types**:

- Single
- Multilevel
- Hierarchical
- (Java doesn't support multiple via classes)

---

## 17. How can we achieve multiple inheritance in Java?

Using **Interfaces**.

```java
interface A { void show(); }
interface B { void display(); }
class C implements A, B { /*...*/ }
```

---

## 18. What is a package? What are the ways of using a package?

Package = Namespace for classes.

**Usage**:

- Define: `package mypack;`
- Import: `import mypack.MyClass;`

---

## 19. What is an exception? What is exception handling?

**Exception**: Error during runtime.

**Handling**:

```java
try {
  // code
} catch (Exception e) {
  // handle
}
```

---

## 20. What is multiprogramming? How can we achieve multithreading in Java?

- **Multiprogramming**: Multiple programs in memory.
- **Multithreading**: Multiple threads in a single program.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
  public void run() { ... }
}
```

---

## 21. Write down the lifecycle of a thread

1. New
2. Runnable
3. Running
4. Blocked/Waiting
5. Terminated

---

## 22. What is a file? Write down the basic file-related operations

A file stores data permanently.

**Operations**:

- Create
- Read
- Write
- Delete

---

## 23. Name the package required for file handling in Java

`java.io` package.

---

## 24. What is a stream? What are its types?

Stream = Sequence of data.

**Types**:

- InputStream / OutputStream (byte)
- Reader / Writer (character)

---

## 25. Name any three classes required for handling files

- `File`
- `FileReader`
- `FileWriter`
