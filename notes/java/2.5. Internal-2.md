## 1. What is bytecode in Java?  



Java Bytecode is an intermidiate representation of a java program generated after compilation. It's not Machine specific & is executed by JVM(Java Virtual Machine), making Java platform-independent.


## Describe the role of Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Development Kit (JDK).

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a platform-independent virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides the runtime environment necessary for Java programs to run on any OS with a compatible JVM implementation. Its platform independence is a core feature of the Java language

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE provides the environment in which Java applications can run. It includes the JVM, core class libraries (like those for I/O, networking, utilities), and other supporting files.

JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is a superset of the JRE and is required for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE along with development tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger (jdb), and other utilities necessary for writing, compiling, and testing Java code.


## What does "public static void main(String[] args) " mean?

This is the main method which serves as the entry point for Java applications.

- `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
- `static`: No object needed to call it.
- `void`: Returns nothing.
- `main`: Entry point of the program.
- `String[] args`: Command line arguments.


## What is the default value of a local variable in Java? 

Local variables in Java do not have a default value. They must be explicitly initialized before they are used. If we try to use an uninitialized local variable, the compiler will throw an error.

## Describe the difference between arrays and strings in Java.

| Feature          | Array                                      | String                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature** | Collection of elements of the same data type | Sequence of characters                        |
| **Mutability** | Mutable (elements can be changed)          | Immutable (once created, its value cannot be changed) |
| **Size** | Fixed size once declared                   | Variable length                               |
| **Declaration** | `int[] numbers = new int[5];`             | `String text = "Hello";`                      |
| **Accessing** | Elements accessed using index (e.g., `numbers[0]`) | Characters accessed using index (e.g., `text.charAt(0)`) |
| **Methods** | Limited built-in methods                   | Rich set of built-in methods for manipulation |


## Write a program to demonstrate string concatenation.

```java
public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String firstName = "soumadip";
        String lastName = "Das";
        String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
        System.out.println("Full Name: " + fullName);
    }
}
```

## What is a constructor? 

In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects of a class when they are created. It has the same name as the class and does not have an explicit return type.
