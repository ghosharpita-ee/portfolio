## 1. What is bytecode in Java?  



Java Bytecode is an intermidiate representation of a java program generated after compilation. It's not Machine specific & is executed by JVM(Java Virtual Machine), making Java platform-independent.


## Describe the role of Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Development Kit (JDK).

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a platform-independent virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides the runtime environment necessary for Java programs to run on any OS with a compatible JVM implementation. Its platform independence is a core feature of the Java language

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE provides the environment in which Java applications can run. It includes the JVM, core class libraries (like those for I/O, networking, utilities), and other supporting files.

JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is a superset of the JRE and is required for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE along with development tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger (jdb), and other utilities necessary for writing, compiling, and testing Java code.


## What does "public static void main(String[] args) " mean?

This is the main method which serves as the entry point for Java applications.

- `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
- `static`: No object needed to call it.
- `void`: Returns nothing.
- `main`: Entry point of the program.
- `String[] args`: Command line arguments.


## What is the default value of a local variable in Java? 

Local variables in Java do not have a default value. They must be explicitly initialized before they are used. If we try to use an uninitialized local variable, the compiler will throw an error.

## Describe the difference between arrays and strings in Java.

| Feature         | Array                                              | String                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**      | Collection of elements of the same data type       | Sequence of characters                                   |
| **Mutability**  | Mutable (elements can be changed)                  | Immutable (once created, its value cannot be changed)    |
| **Size**        | Fixed size once declared                           | Variable length                                          |
| **Declaration** | `int[] numbers = new int[5];`                      | `String text = "Hello";`                                 |
| **Accessing**   | Elements accessed using index (e.g., `numbers[0]`) | Characters accessed using index (e.g., `text.charAt(0)`) |
| **Methods**     | Limited built-in methods                           | Rich set of built-in methods for manipulation            |


## Write a program to demonstrate string concatenation.

```java
public class StringConcatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = "Hello ";
        String b = "World";
        System.out.println(a + b);
    }
}
```

## What is a constructor? 

In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects of a class when they are created. It has the same name as the class and does not have an explicit return type.

### How is it different from a method in Java? 

| Constructor                               | Method                      |
| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Same name as class                        | Any name                    |
| No return type (not even void)            | Must have a return type     |
| Called automatically upon object creation | Needs to be called manually |


### Explain the difference between a default constructor and a parameterized constructor with examples.

- Default Constructor: A default constructor is a constructor that has no parameters. If we don't explicitly define any constructor in our class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor. This default constructor does nothing; it simply initializes the object with default values for its instance variables.

    ```java
    class MyClass {
        int x;
        String s;
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Calls the default constructor
        }
    }
    ```
What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
- Parameterized Constructor: A parameterized constructor is a constructor that accepts one or more parameters. These parameters are used to initialize the instance variables of the object with specific values at the time of object creation.

    ```java
    class Rectangle {
        int width;
        int height;

        public Rectangle(int w, int h) { // Parameterized constructor
            width = w;
            height = h;
        }

        public void Area() {
            System.out.println("Area: " + (width * height));
        }
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Rectangle rect1 = new Rectangle(10, 5); // Calls the parameterized constructor
            rect1.Area(); // Output: Area: 50
        }
    }
    ```

## How do you create a package in Java?**

Packages are created using the `package` keyword at the top of the Java file.

- Example:-

    ```java
    package mypack;

    public class A {
        public void display() {
            System.out.println("Hello Package");
        }
    }
    ```

### Diff between Method Overloading vs Overriding:**

| Feature              | Method Overloading                                                                     | Method Overriding                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Location             | Within the same class                                                                  | In a subclass (inheriting from a superclass)                                   |
| Signature            | Same method name but different parameter lists (number, types, or order of parameters) | Same method name and same parameter list                                       |
| Return Type          | Can be the same or different                                                           | Must be the same or a covariant return type (in later Java versions)           |
| Purpose              | To provide different ways to call the same method with varying input                   | To provide a specific implementation of a method inherited from the superclass |
| Compile-time/Runtime | Determined at compile time (static polymorphism)                                       | Determined at runtime (dynamic polymorphism)                                   |


### How does Java achieve multiple inheritance, give example?

Java does not directly support multiple inheritance of classes. This means a class cannot directly inherit from more than one superclass. 
Java achieves a form of multiple inheritance through interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

```java
interface A { void show(); }
interface B { void display(); }
class C implements A, B {
    public void show() { System.out.println("Show A"); }
    public void display() { System.out.println("Display B"); }
}
```

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism (which means "many forms") is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform manner. In Java, polymorphism is primarily achieved through method overloading and method overriding. 

### What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?

| Feature      | Abstract Class                                                                   | Interface                                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keywords     | abstract class                                                                   | interface                                                                                     |
| Inheritance  | Can extend only one abstract or concrete class                                   | Can implement multiple interfaces                                                             |
| Methods      | Can have abstract and concrete (implemented) methods                             | Can have abstract methods (until Java 7), default and static methods (from Java 8)            |
| Variables    | Can have instance variables (with any access modifier)                           | Can have only public static final constants                                                   |
| Constructors | Can have constructors (not for instantiation, but for subclass initialization)   | Cannot have constructors                                                                      |
| Purpose      | To provide a common base for related classes, can provide partial implementation | To define a contract of methods that classes must implement, focuses on "what" a class can do |

### Write a program to demonstrate the use of dynamic method dispatch.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound(); // Calls Dog's sound()
    }
}
```


## What is exception?

Exception is an event that occurs during runtime and disrupts the normal flow of the program. It's essentially an error condition or an unexpected situation that arises at runtime.

### What are checked and unchecked exceptions?

- Checked Exceptions (Compile-time Exceptions): These are exceptions that the compiler forces to handle. They typically represent exceptional conditions that a well-written program should anticipate and recover from
- Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions): These are exceptions that the compiler does not force to handle. They usually result from programming errors (bugs in our code) and are often indicative of conditions that are difficult or impossible to recover from


### Write a program to demonstrate exception handling using try-catch-finally.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileReader fr = new FileReader("abc.txt");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Always executes");
        }
    }
}
```

## What is multithreading? 

Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.

### What are the states of a thread in Java? 

- **New**: Thread object is created.
- **Runnable**: Thread is ready to run.
- **Running**: Thread is executing.
- **Waiting**: Thread is waiting for a resource.
- **Terminated**: Thread finishes execution.


### How can we achieve multithreading in Java?

In java there are two ways to achieve multithreading:

- **Using the Thread class**: Extend the Thread class and override its run() method.
- **Using the Runnable interface**: Implement the Runnable interface and override its run() method.
