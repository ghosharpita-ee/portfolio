## 1. What are JDK, JRE, JVM?

- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a platform-independent virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It provides the runtime environment necessary for Java programs to run on any OS with a compatible JVM implementation. Its platform independence is a core feature of the Java language

- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE provides the environment in which Java applications can run. It includes the JVM, core class libraries (like those for I/O, networking, utilities), and other supporting files.

- JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is a superset of the JRE and is required for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE along with development tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger (jdb), and other utilities necessary for writing, compiling, and testing Java code.

### Difference between OOP & POP

## What Is The Difference Between OOP and POP?

| **OOP Paradigm**                                      | **POP Paradigm**                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deals with objects and their properties.              | Deals with functions and procedures.                              |
| Follows a bottom-up approach.                         | Follows a top-down approach.                                      |
| Supports data hiding through encapsulation.           | No data hiding mechanism.                                         |
| Supports polymorphism through method overloading and overriding. | Does not support polymorphism; functions/procedures can't take multiple forms. |
| Promotes code reusability and scalability.            | Code reusability is limited and scalability is harder.            |

## 2. Explain the meaning of each word: `public static void main(String args[]) {}`

This is the main method which serves as the entry point for Java applications.

- `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
- `static`: No object needed to call it.
- `void`: Returns nothing.
- `main`: Entry point of the program.
- `String[] args`: Command line arguments.

## 3. What are the types of Data Types in Java?

Data types are divided into two groups:

#### Primitive

Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in Java. They are built into the language and are not objects. They hold direct values of a specific type and size.  

- Includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char

##### byte

An 8-bit signed two's complement integer. Useful for saving memory in large arrays where memory savings are important.

- Range: -128 to 127
- Example: `byte myByte = 100;`

##### short

Short is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer

- Range: -32,768 to 32,767
- Example: `short myShort = 5000;`

##### int

A 32-bit signed two's complement integer. This is the default data type for integral values unless memory is a critical concern.

- Range: Approximately -2 billion to 2 billion
- Example: `int myInt = 100000;`

##### long

A 64-bit signed two's complement integer. Used when a wider range than int is needed.

- Range: Approximately -9 quintillion to 9 quintillion
- Example: `long myLong = 100000000000L;` (Note the 'L' suffix is required for long literals)

##### float

A single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number. Used for decimal numbers when precision is not critical.

- Range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits)
- Example: `float myFloat = 5.75f;` (Note the 'f' suffix is required for float literals)

##### double

A double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number. This is the default for decimal values and provides more precision than float.

- Range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)
- Example: `double myDouble = 19.99;`

##### boolean

Represents a binary value that can only be true or false.

- Range: true or false
- Example: `boolean isJavaFun = true;`

##### char

Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.

- Example: `char myGrade = 'A';`

#### Non-primitive

Non-primitive data types are not predefined by the Java language itself. They are defined by the Java API or created by the programmer. Instead of storing the actual data value directly, they store the memory address (a reference) where the object's data is located.  

- Includes String, Arrays and Classes.

##### String

A sequence of characters represented as a Java object. String objects are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.  
String is a class in the java.lang package.

- Example:

    ```java
    String greeting = "Hello, Java!";
    String name = new String("Alice"); // Can also be created using 'new'
    ```

- Common methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `equals()`, `concat()`

##### Arrays

An array is a fixed-size data structure that stores multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations

- Declaration: `dataType[] arrayName;` or `dataType arrayName[];`
- Example:

    ```java
    int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    System.out.println(numbers[2]);
    ```

:::note
indexing of array starts with 0.  
like 1st element will be at index 0.
:::

##### Classes

User-defined blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and behaviors. Classes are the fundamental units of object-oriented programming in Java.

- Example:

  ```java
  public class Student {
      // Fields (data)
      private String name;
      private int age;
      
      // Constructor
      public Student(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }
      
      // Methods (behavior)
      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }
  }
  ```

- Usage: `Student student = new Student("John", 20);`
