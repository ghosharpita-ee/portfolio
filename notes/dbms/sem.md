## What is a Data Mart?

A **data mart**, is **a specialized subset of a data warehouse that is focused on a specific subject or business area**.

It is designed to be smaller and more manageable than a full data warehouse, offering a focused view of data for a particular team or department.

Data marts are used to support specific analytical needs—like **sales**, **marketing**, or **finance**—and enable faster data access and analysis compared to a larger data warehouse.

## Key Characteristics of a Data Mart

### Subject-Oriented

Data marts focus on a **specific subject or business area**, such as:

- Sales  
- Finance  
- Marketing

### Subset of a Data Warehouse

They are often created as a **smaller, partitioned segment** of a larger enterprise data warehouse.

### Focused Scope

They are designed to address the **specific needs of a particular team or department**, not the whole organization.

### Easier Access and Analysis

- Provide a **more manageable dataset**.
- Make it easier for users to **access and analyze** the data they need quickly.
