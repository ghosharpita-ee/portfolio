## What is Database?

A **database** is a well-organized
collection of data that is structured meaningfully and can be accessed in different logical ways.  
In all databases, the data are stored in an integrated structure, allowing them to be shared.

### Main Features of Data in a Database

- It is well-organized.
- Data is related to each other.
- It is easily accessible in different ways.
- Data is stored efficiently, avoiding unnecessary duplication.

### Characteristics of Database

The data in a database should have the following features:

1. **Shared** - The data in a database are shared among different users or programmers.
2. **Persistence** - Data in a database is stored permanently.
3. **Validity** - Data should be connected with respect to real-world entities, which have physical existence.
4. **Security** - Data should be protected from unauthorized access.
5. **Non-redundancy** - The same data item cannot exist in the same database, i.e., no two data items in a database should represent the same real-world entity.
6. **Independence** - Data at different levels should be independent of each other so that changes in one level should not affect the other level.

## What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software package that manages the specification, organization, storage, retrieval, and modification of data in a database.

It provides users tools to define, create, access, and update the database as per their requirements.

A **DBMS** typically includes one or more specialized programming languages, known as **database languages**, for interacting with the database.
